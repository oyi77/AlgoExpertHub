# SDD Toolkit Rules

## Core Principles

1. **Spec Before Code**: Always create specifications before implementation
2. **Plan Before Build**: Design architecture before coding  
3. **Tasks Before Work**: Break down work into manageable tasks
4. **Evolve as You Build**: Update specs as implementation reveals new insights

## Command Usage

### Quick Mode (80% of features)
Use `/brief [feature-name] [description]` for rapid feature development:
- 30-minute planning
- Start coding immediately
- Perfect for straightforward features

### Full SDD 2.0 Mode (20% of features)
Use full workflow for complex features:
1. `/research [feature-name] [topics]` - Research technologies and patterns
2. `/specify [feature-name]` - Create detailed specifications
3. `/plan [feature-name]` - Design architecture
4. `/tasks [feature-name]` - Break down work
5. `/implement [feature-name]` - Execute implementation

### Escalation
Use `/upgrade [feature-name]` to convert briefs to full workflow when complexity increases.

### Evolution
Use `/evolve [feature-name] [changes]` to keep specs aligned with implementation.

## Documentation Structure

All specifications should be in `specs/active/[feature-name]/`:
- `feature-brief.md` - Quick 30-minute brief
- `research.md` - Research findings
- `spec.md` - Full specification
- `plan.md` - Technical architecture
- `tasks.md` - Task breakdown

## Best Practices

- Keep tasks small (1-2 days max)
- Document all architecture decisions with justification
- Update specs when requirements change
- Maintain version history for significant changes
- Use absolute imports in Python code
- Follow SOLID and DRY principles
- Ensure consistency and adaptability for future changes
