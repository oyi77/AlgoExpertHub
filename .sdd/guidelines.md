# SDD Guidelines

## Spec-Driven Development Best Practices

### Core Principles

1. **Spec Before Code**: Always create specifications before implementation
2. **Plan Before Build**: Design architecture before coding
3. **Tasks Before Work**: Break down work into manageable tasks
4. **Evolve as You Build**: Update specs as implementation reveals new insights

### Workflow Modes

#### Quick Mode (80% of features)
Use `/brief` for rapid feature development:
- 30-minute planning
- Start coding immediately
- Perfect for straightforward features

#### Full Mode (20% of features)
Use full SDD 2.0 workflow:
1. `/research` - Research technologies and patterns
2. `/specify` - Create detailed specifications
3. `/plan` - Design architecture
4. `/tasks` - Break down work
5. `/implement` - Execute implementation

#### Escalation
Use `/upgrade` to convert briefs to full workflow when complexity increases.

### Documentation Standards

#### Feature Brief
- User story
- Key requirements
- Technical notes
- Quick start guidance

#### Specification
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Edge cases
- Error scenarios
- Success criteria

#### Plan
- Architecture overview
- Technology choices with justification
- Security considerations
- Performance requirements
- Testing strategy
- Deployment approach

#### Tasks
- Small, actionable items (1-2 days max)
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies mapped
- Realistic estimates

### Evolution
Use `/evolve` to keep specs aligned with implementation:
- Document changes
- Maintain version history
- Update affected documents
